# 1. Introduction

The goal of the experiment was to develope an automated structural health monitoring system capable of providing early warnings against structural damage. 

## 1.2 Structure & experiment descriptions:
 The experiment in question is regarding how damage can be simulated by removing bracing or loosening bolts within a four-story steel frame structure. To obtain the data, accelerometers were placed throughout the structure to provide measurements of the structural responses. In particular, three sensors per floor. One located at the center, one at the west side and one at the east side, as the MATLAB files indicate. Then, different cases took place in which members were loosen or removed to analyze the output and correlate the difference in acceleration values with the difference in setup.
 
**The different cases were the following,**

- Case 1 - Fully braced configuration.
* Case 2 - All east side braces removed.
* Case 3 - Removed braces on all floors in one bay on southeast corner.
* Case 4 - Removed braces on 1st and 4th floors in one bay on southeast corner.
* Case 5 - Removed braces on 1st floor in one bay on southeast corner.
* Case 6 - Removed braces on all floors on east face, and 2nd floor braces on north faces.
* Case 7 - All braces removed on all faces.
* Case 8 - Configuration 7 + loosened bolts on all floors at both ends of beam on east face, north side.
* Case 9 - Configuration 7 + loosened bolts on floors 1 and 2 at both ends of beam on east face, north side.

It is important to keep in mind the cases since our data belongs to one of the cases.
